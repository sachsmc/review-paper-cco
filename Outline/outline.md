# Statistical Principles for Omics-based Clinical Trials

## Outline

### Before getting started

+ Identifying the clinical use
    - Predictive
    - Prognostic
    - Just a biological question?
    - Examples

### Analytical Validation - Pre-requisite

+ Specimen Issues - Criteria for rejection of poor-quality specimens
    - Sample and specimen handling
+ Assay Issues
    - Assessing and account for lots and batch effects
	- Criteria for rejection of assay results
	- Validating assay performance

	
### Model development and preliminary evaluation

+ Model development study design
	- Testing batch effects -> avoid confounding technical factors with outcome
	- Failure to maintain strict separation
+ Methods for model development
	- Avoid overfitting
	- Weakness of clustering methods
	- Model averaging

### Demonstrating clinical utility

+ Pitfalls
	- Problems with internal validation
	- Partial Resubstitution
	- Reporting only the winner
+ Design for evaluation
	- Whats the use? (performance metric that is clinically relevant)
	- Aspects of signature have undergone sufficient validation
